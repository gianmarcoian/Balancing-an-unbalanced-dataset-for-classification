# Balancing-an-unbalanced-dataset-for-classification

## Forest Cover Type Prediction

Welcome to the Forest Cover Type Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for building predictive models to classify forest cover types based on cartographic variables.

## Project Description
Understanding the distribution of forest cover types is crucial for environmental science and forestry management. This project involves building machine learning models that can accurately predict the forest cover type based on several cartographic variables.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various cartographic variables such as elevation, aspect, distance to water bodies, soil type, etc. The target variable is the "Cover_Type" column, indicating the forest cover type (ranging from 1 to 7).

The dataset is divided into training data (`train.csv`) and testing data (`test.csv`).

## **Note**: The dataset is highly unbalanced, with some classes having significantly fewer samples than others. To address this imbalance, various methodologies have been employed to balance the dataset.

## Evaluation
Model performance will be evaluated using the Macro F1-Score. A Macro F1-Score higher than 0.88 is the target.

## Repository Content
- **`forest.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the project.
- **`train.csv`**: Training dataset.
- **`test.csv`**: Testing dataset.

## Instructions
- Participants must submit their code as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with complete descriptions and explanations.
- The Notebook should include information and visualizations about the problem, data exploration, and modeling process.
- Justify choices of models, features, and hyperparameters.
- Hyperparameter tuning is encouraged.

## Rules and Guidelines
- Any machine learning techniques and libraries can be used.
- External data sources are not allowed.
- Document your approach and methodology in the code or a separate report.
- Only the last submission will be considered for evaluation.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/forest-cover-prediction.git
   cd forest-cover-prediction
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (forest.ipynb)
3. Good Luck and Happy Modeling!
